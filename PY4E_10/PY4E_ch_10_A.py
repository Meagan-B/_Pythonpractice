# Exercise 1: Revise a previous program as follows:
# Read and parse the “From” lines
# pull out the addresses from the line.
# Count the number of messages from each person using a dictionary.
#
# After all the data has been read,
# print the person with the most commits by creating a list of (count, email) tuples from the dictionary.
# Then sort the list in reverse order and print out the person who has the most commits.
