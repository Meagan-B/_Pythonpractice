# Exercise 6: Rewrite the program that prompts the user for a list of numbers and prints out the maximum and minimum of the
# numbers at the end when the user enters “done”. Write the program to store the numbers the user enters in a list and use the
# max() and min() functions to compute the maximum and minimum numbers after the loop completes.
