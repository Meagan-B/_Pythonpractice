# Exercise 4: Find all unique words in a file
#
# List all unique words, sorted in alphabetical order,
# that are stored in a file romeo.txt containing a subset of Shakespeareâ€™s work.
#
# download a copy of the file www.py4e.com/code3/romeo.txt.
# Create a list of unique words, which will contain the final result.
# Write a program to open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line,
# split the line into a list of words using the split function. For each word,
# check to see if the word is already in the list of unique words. If the word is not in the list of unique words,
# add it to the list. When the program completes, sort and print the list of unique words in alphabetical order.



ss_uniq_wrds = list()
# creates empty list for loop below to fill
usr_inp = input('enter file name >>> ')
fhandle = open(usr_inp)
# user inputs file to be processed, open() opens the file

for lines in fhandle :
    words = lines.split()
    # splits the sting of words in fhandle into list items
    for word in words :
        if word in ss_uniq_wrds : continue
        # passes words already collected in our list ss_uniq_wrds
        else :
            ss_uniq_wrds.append(word)
            # adds new words to our list

ss_uniq_wrds.sort()
# sorts our newly created list, because captials sort differently it isnt strickly alphabetical
print(ss_uniq_wrds)
