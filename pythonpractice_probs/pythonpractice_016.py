# Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.
#
# Extra:
#
# Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.
# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

import random
import string

# ----
# pass_rating = input('how strong of a password would you like?\nenter WEAK or STRONG below\n>>> ')

# ----

alpha_lower = string.ascii_lowercase
alpha_upper = string.ascii_uppercase

print(alpha_lower)
print(alpha_upper)

# weak_pass =
# stong_pass =

# if pass_rating == 'WEAK' or pass_rating == 'weak' :

# elif pass_rating == 'STONG' or pass_rating 'strong' :
